# DataHack18
My sister, Sugandh Gupta, and my project for the data science hackathon held in Jerusalem

-------------
Project files:

avocado.csv = data about features of avocados (price, type, quantity, year, region)

Avocado Toast!.ipynb = jupyter notebook with our analysis of predicting avocado prices based on other qualitative and quantitative features.  This file is still under development (especially with application of Random Forest to the predictive modeling)
